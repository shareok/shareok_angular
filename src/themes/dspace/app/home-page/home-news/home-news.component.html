      <p>SHAREOK is the joint institutional repository for the University of Oklahoma Libraries (OU), Oklahoma State University Libraries (OSU), and the University of Central Oklahoma Max Chambers Library (UCO). It serves as the home for the intellectual output of those institutions, such as: digital theses and dissertations, faculty publications, open access publications, open educational resources, institution-specific content and much more.</p>
      <p>If you would like to place your works in the institutional repository, please contact your library: <a href="https://libraries.ou.edu/content/contact-ou-shareok">OU</a>, <a href="https://library.okstate.edu/about/contact-us">OSU</a>, or <a href="mailto:diwg@uco.edu">UCO</a>.
